        <p>~Class of 2018, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
        <p>"I had a strong interest in artificial intelligence when I joined the computer science department, but I had no idea that it would influence the course of my entire career. In addition to offering a strong academic foundation, the teachers in this department also promoted practical initiatives. I took a machine learning course with Dr. Johnson, and I recall working on practical applications. After a few years, I am now in charge of a group at a state-of-the-art AI research facility. My interest became a rewarding job thanks in large part to the department's assistance and advice. I will always be appreciative of the training and guidance I got here."</p><br>
